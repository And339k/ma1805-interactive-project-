With my website I wanted to implument sound and music in some way and some shape or form as It is something which has been quite important and fundamental towards me as a person in my opinion and I believe its something cool and interesting to interact with in terms of sound and coding.
 So I though it would be interesting to create a digital sound board or like the equivalent towards a drum machine online in which people could use in order conjure up a drum pattern.
 similar to like drum patterns and beats in like hip hop music I created the drum machine to look more nostalgic like an old drum machine so I had to look at multiple models for drum machines and then I saw one from 1986. I wanted to imbue a sense of nostalgia and make it look like a retro piece of technology. I had to constantly search how to add boxes and formats and colours in their positioning. Also adding the sounds without script and only html is hard as I had to download these sounboards from these websites.
 This wasnt the most complex html to create but the website still took me a bit of a while to create with the box and the formating exactly.

 I got these sound effects from pixaby which is a royalty free sound effect website in which people of all are able to use sound effects
